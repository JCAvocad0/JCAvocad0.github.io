    <h1>How to find Diamonds(1.17.1)</h1>
    <p>Diamonds may be a hard thing to find, especially early game.but with the strategy listed in this gide, you will be sporting full diamond tools witin two minecraft days.</p>
    <p> firstly though, you have to dig a tunnel to y level 5.</p>
    <p>Ok, a mining strategy that i always use is mining three blocks,then turning to your left and mining a one by one tunnel as far as you can reach and turning to the other side and mining. repeat this until you find diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>You should mine during the night to save daylight hours as if your tunnel is two blocks tall, phantoms don't spawn. And if they spawn, you can stock up on phantom memebranes for slow falling potions.</p>
    <p> another way of finding diamonds is using the clay method.</p>
